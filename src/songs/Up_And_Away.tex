\song{Up And Away}{The Poxy Boggards}{}{Englisch}{Irisch/Schottisch}{

\verse{
\li{Now when \A I was a \E young man we \A lived near the \E sea strand}
\li{and me \A folks kept a \E tavern called the \B Admiral's Head.}
\li{And old \A salts by the \E fireside would \A tell of the \E seas wide}
\li{the \A far foreign shores and the \B lives that they \E led.}
}

\chorus{
\li{And it's up and a\A[]way in the \B mor\Csm[]ning}
\li{oh, the \E tears me poor mother has \B cried.}
\li{But the \A sea it had \E called me and you \A may say I'm \E barmy}
\li{but I \A went to her \E just like a \B bride.}
\li{And it's \Csm up and a\E[]way in the \B mor\E[]ning.}
}

\verse{
\li{Well, I \A walked into \E Bristol with \A cutlass and \E pistol}
\li{a \A new bo'sun's \E whistle and a \B swaggerin' stride.}
\li{And with\A[]out too much \E censure I \A soon was in\E[]dentured}
\li{and em\A[]barked for adventure on a \B bright morning's \E tide.}
}

\chorus{
\li{And it's up and a\A[]way in the \B mor\Csm[]ning}
\li{With the \E wind to our \A backs we will \B sail.}
\li{And the \A ship may well \E take ya from \A here to Ja\E[]maica}
\li{where they \A serve up the \E rum by the \B pail.}
\li{And it's \Csm up and a\E[]way in the \B mor\E[]ning.}
}

\verse{
\li{After \A two months hard \E toil we \A docked in Port Ro\E[]yal}
\li{our \A virtues to \E spoil or at least to cur\B[]tail.}
\li{But the \A trouble with the \E boisterous \A sailors who \E roister's}
\li{their \A choice is to \E run or to \B end up in \E jail.}
}

\chorus{
\li{And it's up and a\A[]way in the \B mor\Csm[]ning}
\li{and the salt spray tastes \A finer than \B wine.}
\li{Dawn \A on the ho\E[]rizon and the \A size of the \E prize}
\li{for the \A taking of a \E ship of the \B line.}
\li{And it's \Csm up and a\E[]way in the \B mor\E[]ning.}
}

\verse{
\li{Now \A some say the \E sea is a \A sickness but \E we}
\li{feel the \A thickness of \E wits lest we're \B shortening sail.}
\li{And \A we see the \E sea glint the \A focsle and \E bowsprit}
\li{and our \A course is well \E plotted and \B runs fore the \E gale.}
}

\chorus{
\li{And it's up and a\A[]way in the \B mor\Csm[]ning}
\li{and \E though we may never come \B home}
\li{we'll \A think of it \E often 'till the \A day that our \E lead-weighted}
\li{ \A coffins get \E tossed in the \B foam.}
\li{And it's \Csm up and a\E[]way in the \B mor\E[]ning.}
}

\verse{
\li{And it's up and a\A[]way in the \B mor\Csm[]ning}
\li{With the \E wind to our \A backs we will \B sail.}
\li{And the \A ship may well \E take ya from \A here to Ja\E[]maica}
\li{where the \A storms and the \E waves they will \A toss ya and \E shake ya}
\li{and you'll \A do desperate \E deeds for which \A God might for\E[]sake ya}
\li{but there's \A nowhere that \E we'd rather \B be.}
\li{And it's \Csm up and a\E[]way in the \B mor\E[]ning.}
