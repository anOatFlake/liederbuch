\verse{
\li{The \Am[]pictures tell the story, this \C[]life has many shades}
\li{I'd \G[]wake up every morning and \Am[]before I'd start each day}
\li{I'd take a \Am[]drag from last night's cigarette that \C[]smoldered in it's tray,}
\li{\G[]down a little something, \Dm[] then be on my way\Am[]}
}

\verse{
\li{\Am[]I traveled far and wide and laid this \C[]head in many ports}
\li{I was  \G[]guided by a compass, I saw \Am[]beauty to the north}
\li{I drew the \Am[]tales of many lives and wore the \C[]faces of my own}
\li{I had these \G[]memories all around me so I  \Dm[]wouldn't be alone
}
}

\chorus{
\li{\C[]Some may be from showing up, \G[] others are from growing up,}
\li{\Dm[]sometimes I was so messed up and \Am[]didn't have a clue}
\li{I ain't \C[] winning no one over, I \G[]wear it just for you,}
\li{I got your \Dm[]name written here in a \Am[]rose tattoo}
\li{In a \Am[]rose tattoo, in a \C[]rose tattoo, I got your \G[]name written here in a \Am[]rose tattoo}

\verse{
\li{\Am[] This one's for the mighty sea, \C[]mischief, gold and piracy}
\li{\G[]This one's for the man that raised me, \Am[]taught me sacrifice and bravery}
\li{\Am[] This one's for our favorite game, \C[]black and gold, we wave the flag}
\li{\G[]This one's for my family name, with \Dm[]pride I wear it to the grave}

\bridge{
\li{\F[]This one means the most to me it \C[]stays here for eternity}
\li{A \G[]ship that always stays the course, an \Am[]anchor for my every choice}
\li{A \F[]rose that shines down from above, I \C[]signed and sealed these words in blood}
\li{I \G[] heard them once, sung in a song, it \Dm[]played again we sang along}
