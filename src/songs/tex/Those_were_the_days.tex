\verse{
\li{\Am[]Once upon a time there was a tavern, where we used to raise a glass or \Dm[]two.}
\li{Remember how we laughed away the \Am[]hours, and \B[7]dreamed of all the great things we would \E[]do.}
\li{Those were the \Am[]days, my friend, we thought they'd \Dm[]never end,}
\li{we'd sing and \G[]dance for \G[7]ever and a \C[]day;}
\li{We'd live the \Dm[]life we choose, we'd fight and \Am[]never lose,}
\li{For we were \E[]young, and sure to have our \Am[]way.}

\verse{
\li{\Am[]Then the busy years went rushing by us. We lost our starry notions on the \Dm[]way.}
\li{If by chance I'd see you in the \Am[]tavern, we'd \B[7]smile at one another, and we'd \E[]say:}
\li{Those were the \Am[]days, my friend, we thought they'd \Dm[]never end,}
\li{we'd sing and \G[]dance for \G[7]ever and a \C[]day;}

\verse{
\li{\Am[]Just tonight I stood before the tavern. Nothing seemed the way it used to \Dm[]be.}
\li{In the glass I saw a strange re\Am[]flection, \B[7]was that lonely woman really \E[]me?}
\li{Those were the \Am[]days, my friend, we thought they'd \Dm[]never end,}
\li{we'd sing and \G[]dance for \G[7]ever and a \C[]day;}

\verse{
\li{\Am[]Through the door there came familiar laughter.}
\li{I saw your face and heard you call my \Dm[]name.}
\li{Oh, my friend, we're older, but no \Am[]wiser.}
\li{For \B[7]in our hearts the dream are still the \E[]same.}
\li{Those were the \Am[]days, my friend, we thought they'd \Dm[]never end,}
